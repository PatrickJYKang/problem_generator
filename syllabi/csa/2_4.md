§ Practice-It!: BJP4 Chapter 3: Parameters and Objects—SelfCheck 3.2–3.9  

Some objects or concepts are so frequently represented that programmers can draw upon existing code that has already been tested, enabling them to write solutions more quickly and with a greater degree of confidence.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-1.F  

# MOD-1.F.1  

Call non-static void methods with parameters.  

A method signature for a method with parameters consists of the method name and the ordered list of parameter types.  

# MOD-1.F.2  

Values provided in the parameter list need to correspond to the order and type in the method signature.  

# MOD-1.F.3  

Methods are said to be overloaded when there are multiple methods with the same name but a different signature.  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine code that would be used to interact with completed program code.  

Write program code to create objects of a class and call methods.
