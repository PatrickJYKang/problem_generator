# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-1  

The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression determines the computed result.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-1.A  

Evaluate arithmetic expressions in a program code.  

# CON-1.A.1  

A literal is the source code representation of a fixed value.  

# CON-1.A.2  

Arithmetic expressions include expressions of type int and double.  

# CON-1.A.3  

The arithmetic operators consist of $+,-,\star,/$ , and $\%$ .  

# CON-1.A.4  

An arithmetic operation that uses two int values will evaluate to an int value.  

# CON-1.A.5  

An arithmetic operation that uses a double value will evaluate to a double value.  

# CON-1.A.6  

Operators can be used to construct compound expressions.  

# CON-1.A.7  

During evaluation, operands are associated with operators according to operator precedence to determine how they are grouped.  

# CON-1.A.8  

An attempt to divide an integer by zero will result in an ArithmeticException to occur.  

# Primitive Types  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-1.B  

# CON-1.B.1  

Evaluate what is stored in a variable as a result of an expression with an assignment statement.  

The assignment operator $(=)$ allows a program to initialize or change the value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is stored in the variable on the left.  

# CON-1.B.2  

During execution, expressions are evaluated to produce a single value.  

# CON-1.B.3  

The value of an expression has a type based on the evaluation of the expression.  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).  

# 5.A  

Describe the behavior of a given segment of program code.
