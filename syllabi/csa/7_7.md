§ Why might you want to use a 2D array to store the spaces on a game board or the pixels in a picture, rather than a 1D array or ArrayList?

· Why does the order in which elements are accessed in 2D array traversal matter in some situations?  

In Unit 6, students learned how 1D arrays store large amounts of related data. These same concepts will be implemented with two-dimensional (2D) arrays in this unit. A 2D array is most suitable to represent a table. Each table element is accessed using the variable name and row and column indices. Unlike 1D arrays, 2D arrays require nested iterative statements to traverse and access all elements. The easiest way to accomplished this is in row-major order, but it is important to cover additional traversal patterns, such as back and forth or column-major.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices  

# 1.B 2.B 2.D 3.E  

Students should be able to determine the result of program code that traverses and manipulates the elements in a 2D array. Traversals of 2D arrays typically require a set of nested loops. Often the extra dimension of a 2D array is difficult for students to envision. Providing students with practice analyzing and tracing traversals of a 2D array, as well as providing them partial program code to complete, helps students take this more abstract concept and make it concrete and replicable.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

Because 2D arrays are traversed using nested loops, the number of times a code segment executes is multiplied. In a nested loop, the inner loop must complete all iterations before the outer loop can continue. It helps to provide students with sample code that will print the values in a 2D array. Teachers can an IDE that shows access to 2D arrays visually and keeps track of the execution count.  

The free-response portion of the exam always includes one question that requires students to write program code involving 2D arrays. Because 2D arrays are arrays where each element is an array, it is not uncommon for the question to require students to write solutions involving array or ArrayList objects as well.  

While there is a specific nested structure to traverse elements in a 2D array in rowmajor order, this structure can be modified to traverse 2D arrays in other ways, such as column-major, by switching the nested iterative statements. Additional modifications can be made to traverse rows or columns in different ways, such as back and forth or up and down. However, when making these adjustments, students often neglect to adjust the bounds of the iterative statements appropriately. Students should practice traversing 2D arrays in these nonstandard ways, being sure to test the boundary conditions of the iterative statements, to be prepared for this type of freeresponse question.
