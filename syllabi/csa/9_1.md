# TOPIC 9.1 Creating Superclasses and Subclasses  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# MOD-3  

When multiple classes contain common attributes and behaviors, programmers create a new class containing the shared attributes and behaviors forming a hierarchy. Modifications made at the highest level of the hierarchy apply to the subclasses.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

MOD-3.B  

# MOD-3.B.1  

Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the superclass.  

A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a superclass.  

# MOD-3.B.2  

Classes that extend a superclass, called subclasses, can draw upon the existing attributes and behaviors of the superclass without repeating these in the code.  

# MOD-3.B.3  

Extending a subclass from a superclass creates an “is-a” relationship from the subclass to the superclass.  

# MOD-3.B.4  

The keyword extends is used to establish an inheritance relationship between a subclass and a superclass. A class can extend only one superclass.
