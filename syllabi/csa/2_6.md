# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# VAR-1  

To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers include variables in their code so that the same algorithm runs using different input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# VAR-1.E  

# VAR-1.E.1  

For String class: a. Create String objects. b. Call String methods.  

String objects can be created by using string literals or by calling the String class constructor.  

# VAR-1.E.2  

String objects are immutable, meaning that String methods do not change the String object.  

# VAR-1.E.3  

String objects can be concatenated using the $+$ or $+=$ operator, resulting in a new String object.  

# VAR-1.E.4  

Primitive values can be concatenated with a String object. This causes implicit conversion of the values to String objects.  

# VAR-1.E.5  

Escape sequences start with a \ and have a special meaning in Java. Escape sequences used in this course include \”, \\, and \n.  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls.  

Write program code to create objects of a class and call methods.
