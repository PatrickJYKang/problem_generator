# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-1  

The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression determines the computed result.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE  

# CON-1.H  

# ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-1.H.1  

Compare object references using Boolean expressions in program code.  

Two object references are considered aliases when they both reference the same object.  

# CON-1.H.2  

Object reference values can be compared, using $==$ and $\!=$ , to identify aliases.  

# CON-1.H.3  

A reference value can be compared with null, using $==$ or $\!=$ , to determine if the reference actually references an object.  

# CON-1.H.4  

Often classes have their own equals method, which can be used to determine whether two objects of the class are equivalent.

§ How does iteration improve programs and reduce the amount of program code necessary to complete a task?   
§ What situations would warrant the use of one type of loop over another?  

This unit focuses on iteration using while and for loops. As you saw in Unit 3, Boolean expressions are useful when a program needs to perform different operations under different conditions. Boolean expressions are also one of the main components in iteration. This unit introduces several standard algorithms that use iteration. Knowledge of standard algorithms makes solving similar problems easier, as algorithms can be modified or combined to suit new situations.  

Iteration is used when traversing data structures such as arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D arrays. In addition, it is a necessary component of several standard algorithms, including searching and sorting, which will be covered in later units.

Students should be able to determine the result of program code that uses iterative statements to represent nonlinear processes in a program. Students should practice determining the number of times a given loop structure will execute. Spending time analyzing existing program code provides opportunities for students to better understand how iterative structures can be set up and used to solve their own problems, as well as the implications associated with code changes, such as how using a different iterative structure might change the result of a set of program code.  

Students should be able to implement program code that uses iterative statements to represent nonlinear processes. Understanding how to write program code that repeats allows students to write programs to solve a wider variety of problems, including those that use data, which will be covered in Units 6, 7, and 8.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

While the concept of iteration is tested in isolation on the multiple-choice exam, it is a foundational concept that students will use along with other topics, such as data structures, on free-response questions. Often, students struggle in situations that warrant variation in the Boolean condition of loops, such as when they want to terminate a loop early. Early termination of a loop requires the use of conditional statements within the body of the loop. If the order of the program statements is incorrect, the early termination may be triggered too early or not at all. Provide students with practice ordering statements by giving them strips of paper, each with a line of program code that can be used to assemble the correct and incorrect solutions. Ask them to reassemble the code and trace it to see if it is correct. Using manipulatives in this way makes it easier for students to rearrange the order of the program code to determine if it is in the correct order.

# SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES  

The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. They were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on p. 159 for more examples of activities and strategies.
