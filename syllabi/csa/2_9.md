# Using Objects  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# MOD-1  

Some objects or concepts are so frequently represented that programmers can draw upon existing code that has already been tested, enabling them to write solutions more quickly and with a greater degree of confidence.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-1.H  

# MOD-1.H.1  

Call static methods.  

Static methods are called using the dot operator along with the class name unless they are defined in the enclosing class.  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-1  

The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression determines the computed result.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-1.D  

Evaluate expressions that use the Math class methods.  

CON-1.D.1  

The Math class is part of the java.lang package.  

# CON-1.D.2  

The Math class contains only static methods.

# CON-1.D  

# CON-1.D.3  

Evaluate expressions that use the Math class methods.  

The following static Math methods—including what they do and when they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference:  

§ int abs(int x) — Returns the absolute value of an int value double abs(double x) — Returns the absolute value of a double value double pow(double base, double exponent) — Returns the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter § double sqrt(double x) — Returns the positive square root of a double value double random() — Returns a double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0  

# CON-1.D.4  

The values returned from Math.random can be manipulated to produce a random int or double in a defined range.

■ How can you use different conditional statements to write a pick-your-own-path interactive story? § Why is selection a necessary part of programming languages?  

Algorithms are composed of three building blocks: sequencing, selection, and iteration. This unit focuses on selection, which is represented in a program by using conditional statements. Conditional statements give the program the ability to decide and respond appropriately and are a critical aspect of any nontrivial computer program. In addition to learning the syntax and proper use of conditional statements, students will build on the introduction of Boolean variables by writing Boolean expressions with relational and logical operators.  

The third building block of all algorithms is iteration, which you will cover in Unit 4. Selection and iteration work together to solve problems.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices  

# 2.B 3.C 4.A 4.C  

Selection allows programmers to incorporate choice into their programs: to create games that react to interactions of the user, to develop simulations that are more real world by allowing for variability, or to discover new knowledge in a sea of information by filtering out irrelevant data. Students should be able to write program code that uses conditional statements for selection. Have students write their program code on paper and trace it with different sample inputs before writing code on the computer.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

Programmers need to make design decisions when creating programs that determine how a program specification will be implemented. Typically, there are many ways in which statements can be written to yield the same result, and this final determination is dictated by the programmer. Exposing students to many different code segments that yield equivalent results allows them to be more confident in their solution and helps expose them to new ways of solving the problem that may be better than their current solution.  

The study of computer science involves the analysis of program code. On the multiplechoice section of the exam, students will be asked to determine the result of a given program code segment based on specific input and on the behavior of program code in general. Students should be able to determine the result of program code that uses conditional statements and nested conditional statements to represent nonlinear processes in a program.  

Often, students will write program code that mishandles one of the given conditions. The ability to trace program code can be valuable when testing programs to ensure that all conditions are met. Testing for the different expected behaviors of conditional statements is a critical part of program development and is useful when writing program code or analyzing given code segments. Students should develop sample test cases to illustrate each unique behavior to aid in finding errors and validating results.
