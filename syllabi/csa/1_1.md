# MOD-1  

Some objects or concepts are so frequently represented that programmers can draw upon existing code that has already been tested, enabling them to write solutions more quickly and with a greater degree of confidence.

MOD-1.A.1  

Call System class methods to generate output to the console.  

System.out.print and System.out. println display information on the computer monitor.  

MOD-1.A.2  

System.out.println moves the cursor to a new line after the information has been displayed, while System.out.print does not.  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# VAR-1  

To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers include variables in their code so that the same algorithm runs using different input values.
