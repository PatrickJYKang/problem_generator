Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# MOD-3  

When multiple classes contain common attributes and behaviors, programmers create a new class containing the shared attributes and behaviors forming a hierarchy. Modifications made at the highest level of the hierarchy apply to the subclasses.

MOD-3.C.1  

Define reference variables of a superclass to be assigned to an object of a subclass in the same hierarchy.  

When a class S “is-a” class T, T is referred to as a superclass, and S is referred to as a subclass.  

# MOD-3.C.2  

If S is a subclass of T, then assigning an object of type S to a reference of type T facilitates polymorphism.  

# MOD-3.C.3  

If S is a subclass of T, then a reference of type T can be used to refer to an object of type T or S.  

# MOD-3.C.4  

Declaring references of type T, when S is a subclass of T, is useful in the following declarations:
