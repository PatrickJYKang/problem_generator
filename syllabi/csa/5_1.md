# AVAILABLE RESOURCES  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

Programmers use code to represent a physical object or nonphysical concept, real or imagined, by defining a class based on the attributes and/or behaviors of the object or concept.

# MOD-2  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-2.A  

Designate access and visibility constraints to classes, data, constructors, and methods.  

# MOD-2.A.1  

The keywords public and private affect the access of classes, data, constructors, and methods.  

# MOD-2.A.2  

The keyword private restricts access to the declaring class, while the keyword public allows access from classes outside the declaring class.  

# MOD-2.A.3  

Classes are designated public.  

# MOD-2.A.4  

Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class. Therefore, instance variables are designated as private.  

# MOD-2.A.5  

Constructors are designated public.  

# MOD-2.A.6  

Access to behaviors can be internal or external to the class. Therefore, methods can be designated as either public or private.  

# Writing Classes  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# MOD-3  

When multiple classes contain common attributes and behaviors, programmers create a new class containing the shared attributes and behaviors forming a hierarchy. Modifications made at the highest level of the hierarchy apply to the subclasses.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-3.A  

# MOD-3.A.1  

Designate private visibility of instance variables to encapsulate the attributes of an object.  

Data encapsulation is a technique in which the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from the user.  

# MOD-3.A.2  

When designing a class, programmers make decisions about what data to make accessible and modifiable from an external class. Data can be either accessible or modifiable, or it can be both or neither.  

# MOD-3.A.3  

Instance variables are encapsulated by using the private access modifier.  

# MOD-3.A.4  

The provided accessor and mutator methods in a class allow client code to use and modify data.
