# TOPIC 10.1 Recursion  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE  

# ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-2.O  

# CON-2.O.1  

Determine the result of executing recursive methods.  

A recursive method is a method that calls itself.  

# CON-2.O.2  

Recursive methods contain at least one base case, which halts the recursion, and at least one recursive call.  

# CON-2.O.3  

Each recursive call has its own set of local variables, including the formal parameters.  

# CON-2.O.4  

Parameter values capture the progress of a recursive process, much like loop control variable values capture the progress of a loop.  

# CON-2.O.5  

Any recursive solution can be replicated through the use of an iterative approach.  

# EXCLUSION STATEMENT-(EK CON-2.O.5):  

Writing recursive program code is outside the scope of the course and AP Exam.  

# CON-2.O.6  

Recursion can be used to traverse String, array, and ArrayList objects.
