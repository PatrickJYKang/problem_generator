While programs are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

IOC-1.A  

Explain the ethical and social implications of computing systems.  

IOC-1.A.1  

System reliability is limited. Programmers should make an effort to maximize system reliability.  

# IOC-1.A.2  

Legal issues and intellectual property concerns arise when creating programs.  

# IOC-1.A.3  

The creation of programs has impacts on society, economies, and culture. These impacts can be beneficial and/or harmful.

Remember to go to AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal Progress Check for this unit.  

Whether assigned as homework or completed in class, the Personal Progress Check provides each student with immediate feedback related to this unit’s topics and skills.

§ How can knowing standard algorithms be useful when solving new problems?  

This unit focuses on data structures, which are used to represent collections of related data using a single variable rather than multiple variables. Using a data structure along with iterative statements with appropriate bounds will allow for similar treatment to be applied more easily to all values in the collection. Just as there are useful standard algorithms when dealing with primitive data, there are standard algorithms to use with data structures. In this unit, we apply standard algorithms to arrays; however, these same algorithms are used with ArrayLists and 2D arrays as well. Additional standard algorithms, such as standard searching and sorting algorithms, will be covered in the next unit.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices  

# 3.D 4.B  

Students should be able to implement program code to create, traverse, and manipulate elements in a 1D array. Traversing elements of a 1D array can be accomplished in multiple ways. Programmers need to make decisions about which loop structure is most effective given the problem they are trying to solve. Some loop structures, such as the enhanced for loop, only allow programmers to examine the data stored in a 1D array structure, while other loop structures allow the data to be manipulated.  

Students should be able to identify and correct errors related to traversing and manipulating 1D array structures. A common run-time error that programmers experience is an out-of-bounds error, which occurs when the program tries to access an element that is beyond the range of elements in a collection. Students should double-check the values of the index being used on at least the initial and final loop iterations to ensure that they aren’t out of bounds.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

A specific iterative structure is commonly used to traverse an array: starting at the beginning and moving toward the last element in the array. When students are asked to determine the result of program code that contains arrays, they often use this same iterative structure. Knowing this iterative structure can be helpful when students use tracing to determine what an algorithm is doing. Students can follow this traversal for the first few iterations and apply that pattern to the remaining elements in the array.  

When preparing for the free-response questions, students should be come familiar with how existing algorithms work, rather than just memorizing the program code. Have students write out an algorithm on paper and test it using manipulatives. This allows students to experience the algorithm on a deeper level than if they simply program it. A strong understanding of how existing algorithms work allows programmers to make modifications to those algorithms to accomplish similar tasks.

# SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES  

The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. They were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on p. 159 for more examples of activities and strategies.
