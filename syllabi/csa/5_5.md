# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# MOD-2  

Programmers use code to represent a physical object or nonphysical concept, real or imagined, by defining a class based on the attributes and/or behaviors of the object or concept.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-2.E  

Define behaviors of an object through void methods with or without parameters written in a class.  

# MOD-2.E.1  

A void method does not return a value. Its header contains the keyword void before the method name.  

# MOD-2.E.2  

A mutator (modifier) method is often a void method that changes the values of instance variables or static variables.  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS 1.B  

Determine code that would be used to complete code segments.
