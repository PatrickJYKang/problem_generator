# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.

CON-2.E  

Represent iterative processes using a for loop.  

# CON-2.E.1  

There are three parts in a for loop header: the initialization, the Boolean expression, and the increment. The increment statement can also be a decrement statement.  

# CON-2.E.2  

In a for loop, the initialization statement is only executed once before the first Boolean expression evaluation. The variable being initialized is referred to as a loop control variable.  

# CON-2.E.3  

In each iteration of a for loop, the increment statement is executed after the entire loop body is executed and before the Boolean expression is evaluated again.  

# CON-2.E.4  

A for loop can be rewritten into an equivalent while loop and vice versa.  

# CON-2.E.5  

“Off by one” errors occur when the iteration statement loops one time too many or one time too few.
