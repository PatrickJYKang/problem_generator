# TOPIC 4.3 Developing Algorithms Using Strings  

# Required Course Content  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls.  

Write program code to satisfy method specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements.  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE

# CON-2.F.1  

For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that involves String objects:  

There are standard algorithms that utilize String traversals to:  

§ Find if one or more substrings has a particular property   
§ Determine the number of substrings that meet specific criteria   
§ Create a new string with the characters reversed   
§ Identify standard algorithms.   
§ Modify standard algorithms.   
§ Develop an algorithm.
