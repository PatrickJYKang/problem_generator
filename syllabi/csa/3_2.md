# TOPIC 3.2 if Statements and Control Flow  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).  

Write program code to satisfy method specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements.  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-2.A  

# CON-2.A.1  

Represent branching logical processes by using conditional statements.  

Conditional statements interrupt the sequential execution of statements.  

# CON-2.A.2  

if statements affect the flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression.  

# CON-2.A.3  

A one-way selection (if statement) is written when there is a set of statements to execute under a certain condition. In this case, the body is executed only when the Boolean condition is true.
