Programmers use code to represent a physical object or nonphysical concept, real or imagined, by defining a class based on the attributes and/or behaviors of the object or concept.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-2.D  

Define behaviors of an object through non-void methods without parameters written in a class.  

# MOD-2.D.1  

An accessor method allows other objects to obtain the value of instance variables or static variables.  

# MOD-2.D.2  

A non-void method returns a single value. Its header includes the return type in place of the keyword void.  

# MOD-2.D.3  

In non-void methods, a return expression compatible with the return type is evaluated, and a copy of that value is returned. This is referred to as “return by value.”  

# MOD-2.D.4  

When the return expression is a reference to an object, a copy of that reference is returned, not a copy of the object.  

# MOD-2.D.5  

The return keyword is used to return the flow of control to the point immediately following where the method or constructor was called.

# MOD-2.D.6  

Define behaviors of an object through non-void methods without parameters written in a class.  

The toString method is an overridden method that is included in classes to provide a description of a specific object. It generally includes what values are stored in the instance data of the object.  

# MOD-2.D.7  

If System.out.print or System.out. println is passed an object, that object’s toString method is called, and the returned string is printed.
