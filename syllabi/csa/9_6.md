# MOD-3  

When multiple classes contain common attributes and behaviors, programmers create a new class containing the shared attributes and behaviors forming a hierarchy. Modifications made at the highest level of the hierarchy apply to the subclasses.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-3.D  

Call methods in an inheritance relationship.  

MOD-3.D.1  

Utilize the Object class through inheritance.  

# MOD-3.D.2  

At compile time, methods in or inherited by the declared type determine the correctness of a non-static method call.  

# MOD-3.D.3  

At run-time, the method in the actual object type is executed for a non-static method call.
