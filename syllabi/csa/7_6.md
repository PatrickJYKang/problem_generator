# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

CON-2.L  

CON-2.L.1  

Apply selection sort and insertion sort algorithms to sort the elements of array or ArrayList objects.  

Selection sort and insertion sort are iterative sorting algorithms that can be used to sort elements in an array or ArrayList.  

# CON-2.M  

Compute statement execution counts and informal run-time comparison of sorting algorithms.  

# CON-2.M.1  

Informal run-time comparisons of program code segments can be made using statement execution counts.
