§ Runestone Academy: AP CSA—Java Review: 3—Variables  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# VAR-1  

To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers include variables in their code so that the same algorithm runs using different input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# VAR-1.B  

# VAR-1.B.1  

Identify the most appropriate data type category for a particular specification.  

A type is a set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on them.  

# VAR-1.B.2  

Data types can be categorized as either primitive or reference.  

# VAR-1.B.3  

The primitive data types used in this course define the set of operations for numbers and Boolean values.  

# VAR-1.C  

# VAR-1.C.1  

Declare variables of the correct types to represent primitive data.  

The three primitive data types used in this course are int, double, and boolean.  

# VAR-1.C.2  

Each variable has associated memory that is used to hold its value.  

# VAR-1.C.3  

The memory associated with a variable of a primitive type holds an actual primitive value.  

# VAR-1.C.4  

When a variable is declared final, its value cannot be changed once it is initialized.  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine code that would be used to complete code segments.  

# 2.A  

Apply the meaning of specific operators.
