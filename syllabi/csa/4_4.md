# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

CON-2.G  

# CON-2.G.1  

Represent nested iterative processes.  

Nested iteration statements are iteration statements that appear in the body of another iteration statement.  

# CON-2.G.2  

When a loop is nested inside another loop, the inner loop must complete all its iterations before the outer loop can continue.
