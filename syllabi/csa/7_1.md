# TOPIC 7.1 Introduction to ArrayList  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# VAR-2  

To manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, programmers write code that groups the data together into a single data structure without creating individual variables for each value.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE  

VAR-2.D  

# ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

VAR-2.D.1  

Represent collections of related object reference data using ArrayList objects.  

An ArrayList object is mutable and contains object references.  

VAR-2.D.2  

The ArrayList constructor ArrayList() constructs an empty list.  

# VAR-2.D.3  

Java allows the generic type ArrayList $<\mathtt{E}>$ , where the generic type E specifies the type of the elements.  

# VAR-2.D.4  

When ArrayList ${<}\mathtt{E}{>}$ is specified, the types of the reference parameters and return type when using the methods are type E.  

# VAR-2.D.5  

ArrayList $<\mathtt{E}>$ is preferred over ArrayList because it allows the compiler to find errors that would otherwise be found at run-time.
