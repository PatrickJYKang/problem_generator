# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-2.I  

For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that requires the use of array traversals:  

§ Identify standard algorithms.   
§ Modify standard algorithms.   
§ Develop an algorithm.  

# CON-2.I.1  

There are standard algorithms that utilize array traversals to:  

§ Determine a minimum or maximum value   
§ Compute a sum, average, or mode   
§ Determine if at least one element has a particular property   
§ Determine if all elements have a particular property   
§ Access all consecutive pairs of elements   
§ Determine the presence or absence of duplicate elements   
§ Determine the number of elements meeting specific criteria  

# CON-2.I.2  

There are standard array algorithms that utilize traversals to:  

§ Shift or rotate elements left or right § Reverse the order of the elements

§ How can we use statement execution counts to choose appropriate algorithms?  

BIG IDEA 3 Impact of Computing  IOC § What personal data is currently being collected, and how?  

As students learned in Unit 6, data structures are helpful when storing multiple related data values. Arrays have a static size, which causes limitations related to the number of elements stored, and it can be challenging to reorder elements stored in arrays. The ArrayList object has a dynamic size, and the class contains methods for insertion and deletion of elements, making reordering and shifting items easier. Deciding which data structure to select becomes increasingly important as the size of the data set grows, such as when using a large real-world data set.  

In this unit, students will also learn about privacy concerns related to storing large amounts of personal data and about what can happen if such information is compromised.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices  

# 2.C 2.D 3.D 5.C  

Students need to consider the impact using ArrayList rather than an array has on the structure of their program code. This includes considering the use of ArrayList methods and the flexibility of a structure with a dynamic size. For instance, the use of an ArrayList will require students to analyze program code that uses method calls.  

Providing students with practice writing programs for data sets of undetermined sized—or at least larger than they would be able to analyze easily by hand—presents a more relevant and realistic experience with data. Additionally, this requires students to focus more on the algorithm and ensuring that it will work in all situations rather than on an individual result.  

With larger data sets, programmers become concerned with the amount of time it will take for their program code to run. Students should have practice determining the number of times a code segment executes; this can help them gain an idea of how long it will take to run a program on a data set of a given size.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

When writing solutions to free-response questions that involve the use of an ArrayList, students are often asked to insert or delete elements from the ArrayList. In these cases, adjustments will need to be made to the loop counter to account for skipping an element or attempting to access elements that no longer exist.  

Students may also be asked to traverse multiple data structures simultaneously. These data structures may be a mixture of array and ArrayList objects. As such, it is very easy for students to become confused about how elements are accessed and manipulated within each structure. Additionally, the size of the data structures may not be the same. In these situations, it is best to have different index variables and bounds checks for each structure to avoid accessing elements that are out-of-bounds.
