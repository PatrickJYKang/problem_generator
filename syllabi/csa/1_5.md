# TOPIC 1.5 Casting and Ranges of Variables  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).  

Explain why a code segment will not compile or work as intended.

§ Runestone Academy: AP CSA—Java Review: 3.6—Casting  

# CON-1  

The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression determines the computed result.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-1.C  

# CON-1.C.1  

Evaluate arithmetic expressions that use casting.  

The casting operators (int) and (double) can be used to create a temporary value converted to a different data type.  

# CON-1.C.2  

Casting a double value to an int causes the digits to the right of the decimal point to be truncated.  

# CON-1.C.3  

Some programming code causes int values to be automatically cast (widened) to double values.  

# CON-1.C.4  

Values of type double can be rounded to the nearest integer by (int) $({\bf x}+0.5)$ or (int) $({\bf x}-0.5)$ for negative numbers.  

# CON-1.C.5  

Integer values in Java are represented by values of type int, which are stored using a finite amount (4 bytes) of memory. Therefore, an int value must be in the range from Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX VALUE inclusive.  

# CON-1.C.6  

If an expression would evaluate to an int value outside of the allowed range, an integer overflow occurs. This could result in an incorrect value within the allowed range.

# Using Objects

# BIG IDEA 1 Modularity MOD  

§ How can we simulate election results using existing program code?  

# BIG IDEA 2 Variables  VAR  

§ How are appropriate variables chosen to represent a remote control?  

BIG IDEA 3 Control  CON · How do the games we play simulate randomness?  

In the first unit, students used primitive types to represent real-world data and determined how to use them in arithmetic expressions to solve problems. This unit introduces a new type of data: reference data. Reference data allows real-world objects to be represented in varying degrees specific to a programmer’s purpose. This unit builds on students’ ability to write expressions by introducing them to Math class methods to write expressions for generating random numbers and other more complex operations. In addition, strings and the existing methods within the String class are an important topic within this unit. Knowing how to declare variables or call methods on objects is necessary throughout the course but will be very important in Units 5 and 9 when teaching students how to write their own classes and about inheritance relationships.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices  

# 1.B 1.C 3.A  

The study of computer science involves implementing the design or specification for a program. This is the fun and rewarding part of computer science, because it involves putting a plan into practice to create a runnable program. In addition to developing their own programs, students should practice completing partially written program code to fulfill a specification. This builds their confidence and provides them opportunities to be successful during these early stages of learning.  

Programmers often rely on existing program code to build new programs. Using existing code saves time, because it has already been tested. By using the String class, students will learn how to interact with and utilize any existing Java class to create objects and call methods.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

During the free-response portion of the exam, students will be required to call methods of classes that they haven’t been exposed to prior to the exam. Students should get plenty of practice identifying the proper parameters to use when calling methods of classes that are provided to them.  

Often, students struggle with free-response questions that require them to work with the String class. Using the Java Quick Reference (p. 219) regularly during class will help students become more familiar with this resource prior to the exam. Paying close attention to the method descriptions will ensure that students use the correct type and order of parameters when calling String methods.  

Practice close reading techniques with students prior to the exam, such as underlining keywords, return types, and parameters. Students have approximately 20 minutes to read, process, and answer each of the four free-response questions. These close reading techniques are valuable in helping students process the questions quickly without inadvertently missing key information.
