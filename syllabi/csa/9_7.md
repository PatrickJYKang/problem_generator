# TOPIC 9.7 Object Superclass  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# MOD-3  

When multiple classes contain common attributes and behaviors, programmers create a new class containing the shared attributes and behaviors forming a hierarchy. Modifications made at the highest level of the hierarchy apply to the subclasses.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# MOD-3.E  

# MOD-3.E.1  

Call Object class methods through inheritance.  

The Object class is the superclass of all other classes in Java.  

# MOD-3.E.2  

The Object class is part of the java.lang package  

# MOD-3.E.3  

The following Object class methods and constructors—including what they do and when they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference:  

■ boolean equals(Object other) String toString()  

# MOD-3.E.4  

Subclasses of Object often override the equals and toString methods with classspecific implementations.

Remember to go to AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal Progress Check for this unit.  

Whether assigned as homework or completed in class, the Personal Progress Check provides each student with immediate feedback related to this unit’s topics and skills.

# Recursion  

# Developing Understanding  

# BIG IDEA 1  

# Control CON  

$-$ What real-world processes do you follow that are recursive in nature? Why do programmers sometimes prefer using recursive solutions when sorting data in a large data set?  

Sometimes a problem can be solved by solving smaller or simpler versions of the same problem rather than attempting an iterative solution. This is called recursion, and it is a powerful math and computer science idea. In this unit, students will revisit how control is passed when methods are called, which is necessary knowledge when working with recursion. Tracing skills introduced in Unit 2 are helpful for determining the purpose or output of a recursive method. In this unit, students will learn how to write simple recursive methods and determine the purpose or output of a recursive method by tracing.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices  

# 1.B 2.C  2.D  

To better understand how recursion works, students should spend time writing their own recursive methods. Often, this can be overwhelming for students. One way to scaffold this skill for students is to require them to write a portion of program code, such as the base case, that can be used to complete the recursive method.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

Students should be able to determine the result of recursive method calls. Tracing the series of calls is a useful way to glean what the recursive method is doing and how it is accomplishing its purpose. Recursive algorithms, such as sorting and searching algorithms, often produce a result much more quickly than iterative solutions. Students also need to understand how many times statements in a recursive solution execute based on given input values.  

Recursion is primarily assessed through the multiple-choice section of the exam. Students are often asked to determine the result of a specific call to a recursive method or to describe the behavior of a recursive method. A call to a recursive method is just like a call to a nonrecursive method. Because a method is an abstraction of a process that has a specific result for each varied input, using a specific input value provides an understanding of how the method functions for that input. By understanding several instances of the method call, students can abstract and generalize the method’s overall purpose or process.  

While students will not be required to write a recursive solution in the free-response section, recursive solutions are often a more straightforward way of writing the solutions than iterative designs. Writing recursive solutions and analyzing calls to recursive methods help engage students with all aspects of recursive methods and provide them with a deeper understanding of how recursion works.
