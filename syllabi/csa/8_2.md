# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

# Traversing 2D Arrays  

Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).  

Determine the number of times a code segment will execute.  

# Required Course Content  

Write program code to create, traverse, and manipulate elements in 2D array objects.  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# VAR-2  

# 4.A  

Use test-cases to find errors or validate results.  

To manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, programmers write code that groups the data together into a single data structure without creating individual variables for each value.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# VAR-2.G  

For 2D array objects:  

· Traverse using nested for loops. § Traverse using nested enhanced for loops.  

# VAR-2.G.1  

Nested iteration statements are used to traverse and access all elements in a 2D array. Since 2D arrays are stored as arrays of arrays, the way 2D arrays are traversed using for loops and enhanced for loops is similar to 1D array objects.  

# VAR-2.G.2  

Nested iteration statements can be written to traverse the 2D array in “row-major order” or “column-major order.”  

# VAR-2.G.3  

The outer loop of a nested enhanced for loop used to traverse a 2D array traverses the rows. Therefore, the enhanced for loop variable must be the type of each row, which is a 1D array. The inner loop traverses a single row. Therefore, the inner enhanced for loop variable must be the same type as the elements stored in the 1D array.

# Inheritance  

# Developing Understanding  

# BIG IDEA 1Modularity  MOD  

· How might the use of inheritance help in writing a program that simulates crops being grown in a virtual world? · How does inheritance make programs more versatile?  

Creating objects, calling methods on the objects created, and being able to define a new data type by creating a class are essential understandings before moving into this unit. One of the strongest advantages of Java is the ability to categorize classes into hierarchies through inheritance. Certain existing classes can be extended to include new behaviors and attributes without altering existing code. These newly created classes are called subclasses. In this unit, students will learn how to recognize common attributes and behaviors that can be used in a superclass and will then create a hierarchy by writing subclasses to extend a superclass. Recognizing and utilizing existing hierarchies will help students create more readable and maintainable programs.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices  

# 1.A 1.C  3.A 3.B  5.A 5.B  5.D  

Students can design hierarchies by listing the attributes and behaviors for each object and pulling common elements into a superclass, leaving unique attributes and behaviors in the subclass. By creating a hierarchy system, students only need to write common program code one time, reducing potential errors and implementation time. This also allows for changes to be made more easily, because they can be made at the superclass level in the hierarchy and automatically apply to subclasses.  

During the development of a program, programmers often use comments to describe the behavior of a given segment of program code and to describe the initial conditions that are used. Students who develop the skill of explaining why program code does not work, such as methods being overloaded improperly or superclass objects attempting to call subclass methods, are much better equipped to foresee and avoid these hierarchy issues.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

One question on the free-response section of the exam will require students to write a class. This class could be part of an inheritance relationship. When overriding superclass methods in a subclass, method signatures must be the same. This includes the number, type, and order of any parameters of the overridden method. It is important for students to recognize when a method should be overridden, as well as when they can and should use methods from the superclass. Students who duplicate code unnecessarily will not earn full points on this question.  

Students will be asked to analyze program code that uses inheritance. In many cases, students struggle with determining whether a method is available to be called by an object of a class. When a method is called on a subclass object, the method that is executed is determined during run-time. If the subclass does not contain the called method, the superclass method will automatically be executed.
