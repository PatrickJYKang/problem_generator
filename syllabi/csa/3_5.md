# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

CON-2.B  

CON-2.B.1  

Represent branching logical processes by using nested conditional statements.  

Nested if statements consist of if statements within if statements.  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-1  

The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression determines the computed result.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-1.F  

# CON-1.F.1  

Evaluate compound Boolean expressions in program code.  

Logical operators !(not), &&(and), and ||(or) are used with Boolean values. This represents the order these operators will be evaluated.  

# CON-1.F.2  

An expression involving logical operators evaluates to a Boolean value.  

# CON-1.F.3  

When the result of a logical expression using && or || can be determined by evaluating only the first Boolean operand, the second is not evaluated. This is known as short-circuited evaluation.
