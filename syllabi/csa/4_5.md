Determine the number of times a code segment will execute.  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-2.H  

# CON-2.H.1  

Compute statement execution counts and informal run-time comparison of iterative statements.  

A statement execution count indicates the number of times a statement is executed by the program.

BIG IDEA 3 Impact of Computing IOC § What responsibility do programmers have for the consequences of programs they create, whether intentional or not?  

This unit will pull together information from all previous units to create new, user-defined reference data types in the form of classes. The ability to accurately model real-world entities in a computer program is a large part of what makes computer science so powerful. This unit focuses on identifying appropriate behaviors and attributes of real-world entities and organizing these into classes. Students will build on what they learn in this unit to represent relationships between classes through hierarchies, which appear in Unit 9.  

The creation of computer programs can have extensive impacts on societies, economies, and cultures. The legal and ethical concerns that come with programs and the responsibilities of programmers are also addressed in this unit.  

# Building Computational Thinking Practices

Computer scientists use computers to study and model the world, and this requires designing program code to fit a given scenario. Spending time to plan out the program up front will shorten overall program development time. Practicing elements of the iterative development process early and often will help create more robust programs and avoid logical errors.  

Because revisions to program code are rarely completed by the original author, documenting program code is very important. It allows programmers to more quickly understand how a code segment functions without having to analyze the program code itself. Well-written documentation includes a description of the behavior, as well as the initial conditions that must be met for a code segment to work as intended.  

Sometimes students struggle to explain why a code segment will not compile or work as intended. It helps to have students work with a collaborative partner to practice verbally  

explaining the issues. The ability to explain why a code segment isn’t working correctly assists in the development of solutions.  

# Preparing for the AP Exam  

On the free-response section of the exam, students are required to design program code that demonstrates the functionality available for an object of a new class, based on the prompt’s specification. This process includes identifying the attributes (data) that define an object of a class and the behaviors (methods) that define what an object of a class can do. Students should have many opportunities in this course to design their own classes based on program specifications and on observations of real-world objects.  

Once the new class is designed, students should be able to implement program code to create a new type by creating a class. The behaviors of an object are expressed through writing methods in the class, which include expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements. By being able to create their own classes, programmers are not limited to the existing classes provided within the Java libraries and can therefore represent their own ideas through classes.
