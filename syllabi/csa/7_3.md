# TOPIC 7.3 Traversing ArrayLists  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls.  

Write program code to create, traverse, and manipulate elements in 1D array or ArrayList objects.  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# VAR-2  

To manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, programmers write code that groups the data together into a single data structure without creating individual variables for each value.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# VAR-2.E  

For ArrayList objects:  

a. Traverse using a for or while loop b. Traverse using an enhanced for loop  

# VAR-2.E.1  

Iteration statements can be used to access all the elements in an ArrayList. This is called traversing the ArrayList.  

# VAR-2.E.2  

Deleting elements during a traversal of an ArrayList requires using special techniques to avoid skipping elements.  

# VAR-2.E.3  

Since the indices for an ArrayList start at 0 and end at the number of elements - 1, accessing an index value outside of this range will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown.  

# VAR-2.E.4  

Changing the size of an ArrayList   
while traversing it using an   
enhanced for loop can result in a   
ConcurrentModificationException being thrown. Therefore, when using   
an enhanced for loop to traverse an   
ArrayList, you should not add or   
remove elements.  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Write program code to create, traverse, and manipulate elements in 1D array or ArrayList objects.  

# 4.A  

Use test-cases to find errors or validate results.
