# TOPIC 8.1 2D Arrays  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# VAR-2  

To manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, programmers write code that groups the data together into a single data structure without creating individual variables for each value.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# VAR-2.F  

# VAR-2.F.1  

Represent collections of related primitive or object reference data using two-dimensional (2D) array objects.  

2D arrays are stored as arrays of arrays. Therefore, the way 2D arrays are created and indexed is similar to 1D array objects.  

X  EXCLUSION STATEMENT—(EK VAR-2.F.1): 2D array objects that are not rectangular are outside the scope of the course and AP Exam.  

# VAR-2.F.2  

For the purposes of the exam, when accessing the element at arr[first][second], the first index is used for rows, the second index is used for columns.  

# VAR-2.F.3  

The initializer list used to create and initialize a 2D array consists of initializer lists that represent 1D arrays.  

# VAR-2.F.4  

The square brackets [row][col] are used to access and modify an element in a 2D array.  

# VAR-2.F.5  

“Row-major order” refers to an ordering of 2D array elements where traversal occurs across each row, while “column-major order” traversal occurs down each column.
