To manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, programmers write code that groups the data together into a single data structure without creating individual variables for each value.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# VAR-2.B  

Traverse the elements in a 1D array.  

# VAR-2.B.1  

Iteration statements can be used to access all the elements in an array. This is called traversing the array.  

# VAR-2.B.2  

Traversing an array with an indexed for loop or while loop requires elements to be accessed using their indices.  

# VAR-2.B.3  

Since the indices for an array start at 0 and end at the number of elements - 1, "off by one" errors are easy to make when traversing an array, resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown.
