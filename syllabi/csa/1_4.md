# TOPIC 1.4 Compound Assignment Operators  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-1  

The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression determines the computed result.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

CON-1.B  

CON-1.B.4  

Evaluate what is stored in a variable as a result of an expression with an assignment statement.  

Compound assignment operators $(+=,-=,\star=,$ $\slash=,\mathtt{s}=\mathtt{}$ can be used in place of the assignment operator.  

# CON-1.B.5  

The increment operator $(++)$ and decrement operator $(--)$ are used to add 1 or subtract 1 from the stored value of a variable or an array element. The new value is assigned to the variable or array element.  

# EXCLUSION STATEMENT-(EK CON-1.B.5):  

The use of increment and decrement operators in prefix form (i.e., $++{\bf x})$ and inside other expressions (i.e., $\arctan(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{+}])$ is outside the scope of this course and the AP Exam.
