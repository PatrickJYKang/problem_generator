# TOPIC 7.4 Developing Algorithms Using ArrayLists  

# Required Course Content  

# ENDURING UNDERSTANDING  

# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that requires the use of ArrayList traversals:  

CON-2.J  

§ Identify standard algorithms.   
§ Modify standard algorithms.   
§ Develop an algorithm.  

# CON-2.J.1  

There are standard ArrayList algorithms that utilize traversals to:  

· Insert elements   
· Delete elements   
· Apply the same standard algorithms that are used with 1D arrays  

# CON-2.J.2  

Some algorithms require multiple String, array, or ArrayList objects to be traversed simultaneously.
