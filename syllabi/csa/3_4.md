# CON-2  

Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values.  

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE  

# CON-2.A  

# CON-2.A.5  

Represent branching logical processes by using conditional statements.  

A multi-way selection is written when there are a series of conditions with different statements for each condition. Multi-way selection is performed using if-else-if statements such that exactly one section of code is executed based on the first condition that evaluates to true.  

# Boolean Expressions and if Statements  

# SUGGESTED SKILLS  

Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).  

Write program code to satisfy method specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements.
