## Basic Workflow
1. Select a course and lesson
2. Click "Generate Problem"
3. Write your solution in the code editor
4. Test with "Run Code"
5. Verify with "Check Answer"

## Common Issues

**Java Code**
- Remember to keep the `public class Main` declaration (you do not have to name the class `Main`).
- Don't include package declarations

**C++ Code**
- Include necessary headers (e.g., `#include <iostream>`)
- Use `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input/output

**EOF Errors or Unexpected Outputs**

- Make sure to add inputs in the input field in the bottom right before you run your code
- Python will return an `EOF Error`, Java will return a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` (if using the Scanner class), and C++ may return unexpected outputs

**Test Cases**
- Ensure your output exactly matches the expected format
- Check for trailing or leading spaces or newlines
- Check that you are outputting the correct number of decimal places
- Check your input format

**Error Messages**
- Timeout: Your code took too long to execute
- Compilation error: Syntax issues in your code

All code runs securely in your browser. **Your work and Assistant chats are not automatically saved**.

## Contact

If you have any questions or issues, please email [patrick.jy.kang@gmail.com](mailto:patrick.jy.kang@gmail.com) or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/PatrickJYKang/problem_generator/issues). For issues with specific problems, because all problems are AI generated and the prompts and such used to generate them are still at a very early stage in development, please do not expect them to be perfect. If specific problems do have issues, generally, please do not raise a new issue on GitHub, but if repeated issues with similar requests persist, please do raise an issue or email me.
